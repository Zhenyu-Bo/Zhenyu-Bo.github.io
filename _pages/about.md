Iâ€™m a junior student from the School of Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China(USTC) and I'm a member of Huaxia Computer Science and Technology Elite Program. In addition to my major in computer science, I also minor in finance.

My research lies in **AI Agent**, **Multimodal Learning**, etc. I am currently an undergraduate at USTC and working at [CODIA](https://code.bdaa.pro/) team.

You can find my CV here: [CV](../files/CV-USTC-ZhenyuBo.pdf).
You can contact me through [Email](mailto:bzy1117@mail.ustc.edu.cn) or [Wechat](../files/wechat.jpg).

Research Experience
======
**1. Cognitive Diagnosis Optimization**
Now I'm working at at [CODIA](https://code.bdaa.pro/dashboard/) team which focus on diagnosing the student's ability level based on the student's historical answer records. I have successfully improved the fairness and accuracy of the prediction of the model.

**2. Code Assistant**
It is one of my curriculum projects and can be accessed via [Code-Assistant](https://github.com/Zhenyu-Bo/Code-Assistant).

**Motivation:**
* LLMs lack awareness of untrained repositories, making it difficult to retrieve code information relevant to current needs.
* code repositories often contain massive files, and token limits combined with models' constrained long-context comprehension prevent inputting all information as prompts. 

**Solution:**
My strategy is using RAG to provide precise information which LLMs exactly need to improve code awareness of LLM and reduce context overhead. To be more specific yet concise, I construct a function call dependency table for files in the code repository, then extract all relevant functions based on user requests and inject them as prompts into LLMs.

**3. FreeRTOS Security Enhancement**
It is also one of my curriculum projects and can be accessed via [mustrust](https://github.com/OSH-2024/mustrust).

**Description:**
We use Rust to rewrite the core code of FreeRTOS (using C) to improve security.
